# Medical Stores Optimal Routing

A GIS-based solution for finding optimal delivery routes from medical stores with specific medicines available to customer addresses.

## Project Overview

This project implements an optimal routing system for medical store deliveries using ArcGIS Python API. The system:
- Filters medical stores based on medicine availability (Metformin)
- Calculates optimal delivery routes using Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) algorithm
- Visualizes routes and provides detailed delivery schedules
- Generates delivery instructions and cost analysis

## Features

- **Medicine Availability Filtering**: Filters stores based on specific medicine stock
- **Optimal Route Calculation**: Uses ArcGIS Network Analysis to solve Vehicle Routing Problem
- **Visualization**: Interactive maps showing delivery routes
- **Detailed Reports**: CSV exports with route details, stops, costs, and timing
- **Multi-route Support**: Handles multiple stores and delivery vehicles simultaneously
